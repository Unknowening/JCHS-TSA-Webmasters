                        Students will learn the basic components of 2-D and 3-D animation development from storyboarding elements to fundamental software capabilities. The course serves as an introduction to animation history, keyboarding shortcuts, project filing, and career awareness. Instruction in this course focuses on basic drawing and software training, storyboard creation, the physics and anatomy of motion, technology of animation, properties and use of color, cameras and lighting, fundamentals of modeling and animating, creating a portfolio and file management. Students will work productively and responsibly in individual and collaborative settings. This introductory pathway course of three sequenced courses will give students the opportunity to earn an industry credential in animation. No prerequisite for this course.

                        Students will continue to develop and implement aesthetics of color selection, storyboarding in 2-D digital animation, and develop animatic creations from 2-D to 3-D. Students in this course will learn interface tools, the use of drawing tools, animating the camera, importing images, working with sound and lip syncing, understanding paths and motion design, and frame by frame animation creation relative to sequence planning and pacing. This course will allow students to explore more advanced aspects of character animation including subtle character gesture and advanced action timing with emphasis on personal observation. This course will allow students to build on previously learned storyboarding skills, develop scripts, determine character motivations, consider setting and motion variables, and learn other unique traits of animation through integrated activities.

                        In this course students will continue working in 2-D and 3-D environments by importing 3- D models while working in 3-D space morphing, and inverse kinematics. Students will acquire knowledge of human and animal animations, apply the aesthetic and technical aspects of animation of characters, and analyze the physics and physicalization of action, weight, and timing. The course advances students’ knowledge of sound integration into animated products; by focusing on skills that include lip-syncing, voice overs, and synchronization. Portfolio development will include animation reels and other products. Students will learn the processes of post-production and will work both independently and in small production teams to manage the production pipeline for a 3-D project. In the final phases of the project completion, students will work collaboratively to meet deadlines and will be expected to produce an animated final project that reflects competency with editing, rendering, updating reel, and self-promotional support items. Students may also develop a working game or app or animated video as a final project. Through the exploration of projects, students will continue to work independently and collaboratively to develop content delivery, story and technical mastery. Prerequisite: Principles and Concepts of Animation.

                        JCHS has a state-of-the-art lab utilizing industry standard equipment to learn the basics of engineering practices. During the year, individual work, group work and engineering training modules will be used as students explore basic engineering practices used in industry. Companies will be formed and students will use skills learned in the trainers to design and build projects. During the projects, a corporate structure is used as well as, teamwork, company logo, a video, brochure, web page, Power Point presentation, and company t-shirts will be made along with a fully functioning prototype of the product. Students will learn how to safely use equipment from basic hand and power tools to industrial robots and computer controlled milling machines. Foundations of Engineering Technology is the first course of a possible four-year track in Engineering.

                        A more in-depth study of various engineering practices will take place in Engineering Concepts. As more advanced engineering skills are learned, students take on many of the challenges faced in real life engineering careers. Some design projects in Engineering Concepts include: Hovercrafts, Solar Fuel Cell Vehicles, Ergonomic Workstations, and Handicap Lifting Devices. Prerequisite: Foundations of Engineering Technology.

                        This course provides students with the unique opportunity to design and build their own projects. After completing some of the engineering training stations the R&D students will design and build their own master project. During the first three years of this program students have been given projects to complete. In year four ,the students take their gained knowledge to design and build their own projects. Prerequisite: Engineering Applications.
